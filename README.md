## About The Project

Discord stores **every, single, image** you view onto your hard drive; and this can lead to bad things, especially if someone sends you questionable material.
This script eliminates those issues, by automatically deleting all the files; on a timed schedule, the schedule is done via Windows Task Scheduler.

## Important

I highly recommend watching [this video](https://youtu.be/7Zz3nUI7pVs); it's hard to explain in text form.


## Alert

When your adding the Discord file to start automatically;
In the argument box; paste this `--processStart Discord.exe --process-start-args --start-minimized`

Change `Discord.exe` to the version, you're using.
I'll eventually make this automated.

and, also - copy the program path, without the quotations into `Start in`.

You could watch **[this update video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuH3hIIT7DE)**, which covers this alert section ðŸ˜‰
